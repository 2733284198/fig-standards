HTTP Client Meta Document
=========================

## Summary

## Why bother?

## Scope

### Goals

* A common interface for sending PSR-7 messages.   

### Non-Goals

* The purpose of this PSR is not to support asynchronous HTTP clients.  
* This PSR will not include how to configure a HTTP client. It does only
specify the default behaviours.
