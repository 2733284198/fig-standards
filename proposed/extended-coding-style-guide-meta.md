Reasons for proposal

3. Scope
--------

## 3.1 Goals

This PSR shares the same goals as PSR-2.

> The intent of this guide is to reduce cognitive friction when scanning code from
> different authors. It does so by enumerating a shared set of rules and expectations
> about how to format PHP code.
> When various authors collaborate across multiple projects, it helps to have one set
> of guidelines to be used among all those projects. Thus, the benefit of this guide is
> not in the rules themselves, but in the sharing of those rules.

This PSR is an extension of PSR-2, and therefore also an extension of PSR-1. It shall be
included in the document that compliance with PSR-N implictly requires compliance with
PSR-2 and PSR-1.

This PSR will include coding style guidelines related to new functionality added to PHP
after the publication of PSR-2; this includes PHP 5.5, PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0.

This PSR will also include clarifications on the text of PSR-2, as described in the PSR
2 Errata.

## 3.2 Non-Goals

It is not the intention of this PSR to add entirely new coding style guidelines that
were available to be considered for inclusion in PSR-1 or PSR-2.

PSR-N will also not change anything stipulated in PSR-1 and PSR-2.

4. Approaches
-------------

The overarching approach is to attempt to apply existing PSR-2 styling and rationale to
new functionality as opposed to establishing a new conventions.
